# Code-Your-Own-Quiz

In this project, you will use the Python programming language to build your own quiz. You will use a fill-in-the blank style to create a quiz that can even be used as a study tool to help you remember important vocabulary.

## Game Review

In this portion of the review, your reviewer will be checking to make sure the game works the way it's supposed to.

## Code Review

Your reviewer will also look at the Python code you've written and provide feedback on:

* Use of Variables: Your code should take advantage of variables and variable names should reflect the values they store.

* Functions: Your code should use functions appropriately to avoid repetition. Function parameters should have logical names and should all be used in the body of the function.

* Appropriate use of Data: Data types (```strings``` vs ```lists``` for example) should be used appropriately.

* Appropriate use of other coding techniques: Your code should use statements like ```if```, ```elif```, ```else```, ```while```, etc... appropriately.

* Each function includes a comment: Comments explain function behavior, inputs, and outputs (if applicable.)
